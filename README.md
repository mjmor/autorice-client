# i3autorice

i3autorice (working title) is a project that is going to offer an auto-configuration tool for 'ricing' [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) desktops. 

i3autorice will be able to automatically retrieve and configure i3 desktops from a community website where everyone can share their rices, including every configuration that contributes to the 'look' of the rice. (i.e. i3status, conky, terminal, etc.) Users will be given an option to opt-out from certain parts of the config, and a prompt to skip/install missing software. All personal configs will be backed up before installation of community rice takes place.

Website will offer a voting system and an interface for easily sharing all dotfiles associated with your rice.

Language: TBD

Website stack: TBD
